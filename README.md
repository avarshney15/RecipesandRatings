# Recipes and Ratings Project
## Overview
This is our final project for DSC 80, focussing on the relationship between the ratings and the overall difficulty of making that meal. 
## Introduction
As college students, we barely have time during the day to cook fresh meals that we have grown accustommed to throughout our lives, heck we barely know how to cook! Plus the rising costs of doordashing, uber eating or eating outside will definitely drain our bank accounts. With the average cost of fastfood rising by around 7% in April according to data from Kalinowski Equity Research, we thought we could investigate the relationship between the difficulty in making a meal and its overall rating. Our aim is to identify meals which are relatively simple to make and are tasty. To do so, we have found a dataset containing recipes orginally scraped from food.com and another dataset which contains the ratings and reviews given by users. <br>

The recipes dataset has 83782 rows with the following 12 columns:<br>

The second dataset, interactions, has 731927 rows with the following 5 columns:<br>

Based on these two datasets we will investigate the relationship between the difficulty in making a recipe and its rating, to identify easy to make recipes for college students which also taste good. The columns relevant to finding out the difficulty of a recipe are the number of steps, and the time taken to make the recipe.
